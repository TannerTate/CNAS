## DartsMore 

The originals code is available at [Darts](https://github.com/quark0/darts)

## Requirements

+ Python >= 3.6

+ Pytorch >= 1.x

+ torchvision == 0.2.1

NOTE: pytorch 0.4.x also work ok, but will meet [ConnectionResetError](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/9127)
When use the second approximation. 

Todo:

- [ ] Give up mixed up operation.

- [ ] Search other basic cells for image segmentation. 

- [ ] Replace the argmax approach to derive architecture by other encoder methods
      such as LSTM.
      
      
> Note that: We will release all of code when our paper under review!!
  Please wait it.
